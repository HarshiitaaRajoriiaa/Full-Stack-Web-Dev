// Jargons, interview questions, and other basics.


//* simple primitives:
//? write a code to greet a user given their first name and last name.
//?write a code to greet a user based on their gender.{if else}
//?write a code that counts from 0 to 1000 and print (for loop.)

// let, var = original way to define a variable, const

//*can be redeclare and rewrite:
var a=1;
a=2;
var a = 3;
console.log(a)


// * can't be redeclare and can be rewrite:
let b=1;
b=2;
console.log(b)


//* complex primitives:
//? write a code that prints even number in the array.
//? write a code that prints largest number in the array.
//?write a code that prints all the male people's first name given a complex object.
//?write a code that reverses all the elements of the array.
